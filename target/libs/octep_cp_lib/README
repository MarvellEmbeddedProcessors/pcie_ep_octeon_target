Library Directory structure {#section1}
=======================

Tree below describes the most important directories in library structure for end user::

    octep_cp_lib
    |-- include - Public header files for library users
    |-- compat - compatibility header files for different platforms
    |-- soc - internal api implementation for different platforms


Build pre-requisites {#section2}
========================

The library requires a set of packages to be built. At minimum the library requires the following
packages:

* libconfig
* pkg-config

Libconfig {#section3}
---------

Library uses configuration files that are being read and parsed by the libconfig library so
the cross-compiler needs to have access to it.  To cross-compile libconfig download its sources
from [Github](https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/dist/libconfig-1.7.2.tar.gz) then unpack
and compile it via:

LIBCONFIG_DIR is directory where libconfig tarball is extracted
BUILD_DIR is directory where extracted libconfig code will be built
PREFIX_DIR is directory where libconfig artifacts will be installed

```bash
    mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR/libconfig
    cd $BUILD_DIR/libconfig
    $LIBCONFIG_DIR/configure --host=aarch64-marvell-linux-gnu \
                             --prefix=$PREFIX_DIR
    make all
    make install
```

Library {#section4}
---

LIB_DIR is location of library source code
PREFIX_DIR is the location of installed dependencies

```bash

  cd $LIB_DIR
  make PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX_DIR/lib
```

Optional parameters for make are

- PLAT=<aarch64(default)/x86_64>


Following artifacts will be available in ``LIB_DIR``:

- Libraries liboctep_cp.a and liboctep_cp.so
