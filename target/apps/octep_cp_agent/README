Control Plane (CP) comprises of all control or status messages exchanged between an Octeon device and Host side drivers/applications.
The Octeon Control Plane Agent is an application that runs on the Octeon which handles these messages in lieu of the Octeon,
and facilitates this control plane functionality.

Build pre-requisites {#section2}
========================

The application requires a set of packages to be built. At minimum the application requires the following
packages:

* libconfig
* pkg-config
* liboctep_cp.a
* liboctep_cp.so

Libconfig {#section3}
---------

Application uses configuration files that are being read and parsed by the libconfig library.
To cross-compile libconfig download its sources from
[Github](https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/dist/libconfig-1.7.2.tar.gz)
then unpack, compile and install it.

eg.
```bash
    export CROSS_COMPILE=<path to cross compiler>
    export PATH=$PATH:<path to aarch64-marvell-linux-gnu-xxxx tools>
    mkdir libconfig-dep
    cd libconfig-dep
    mkdir bin
    wget --no-check-certificate https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/dist/libconfig-1.7.2.tar.gz
    tar xf libconfig-1.7.2.tar.gz
    cd libconfig-1.7.2
    ./configure --host=aarch64-marvell-linux-gnu --prefix=`pwd`/../bin
    make all
    make install
```

libconfig artifacts should be available in bin folder.


Application {#section4}
-----------

APP_DIR is location of application source code
PREFIX_DIR is the

```bash

  cd $APP_DIR
  make CC=$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc LD=$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
  CFLAGS="-I<path to octep_cp_lib/bin/include> -I<path to libconfig/include"
  LDFLAGS="-L<path to liboctep_cp -L<path to libconfig>"
```

Optional parameters for make are

- PLAT=<aarch64(default)/x86_64>
- INSTALL_PATH=<$APP_DIR/bin(default)>

Following artifacts will be available in `INSTALL_PATH/bin`:

- octep_cp_agent
- octep_cp_agent-shared


How to run application {#section5}
----------------------
Copy following files to a directory RUN_DIR

$CP_LIB_DIR/liboctep_cp.so
$INSTALL_PATH/bin/octep_cp_agent
$INSTALL_PATH/bin/octep_cp_agent-shared
$APP_DIR/*.cfg

Run the app as follows

```bash

  cd $RUN_DIR
  ./octep_cp_agent `pwd`/<soc>.cfg

  <soc> has to replaced with soc name of the target on which the app is to be run.

  Optional parameters
  -y <milliseconds> yield cpu for msecs between subsequent calls to msg poll (default: 1ms)
  -m <1-n> Max control messages and events to be polled at one time (default: 6)
  htop can be used to check cpu usage by the app

Editing config files {#section6}
--------------------
The config files provide various card specific information for the CP agent to parse, such as details about number of PEMs,
number of PFs per PEM, number of VFs per PF, default MAC address of each interface etc.

The default configurations for the interfaces will be parsed out from provided config file by the CP agent app.
The default configurations currently expected to be provided by a config file include:

- Number of PEMs - including indices of respective PEMs.
- Number of PFs per PEM - including indices of respective PFs.
- Number of VFs per PF - including indices of respective VFs.
- Default MAC address of each interface, where interface can be a PF or a VF. Users can edit
  the default MAC and is of the following format:

    mac_addr = [0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX];

  where XX indicate specific bytes in hex.

- Default link state of each interface, where interface can be a PF or a VF.

    eg: link_state = 0;

- Default receive state (rx state) of each interface.

    eg: rx_state = 0;

- Default autonegotiation flags an interface provides.

    eg: autoneg = 0x3;

- Default pause mode flags an interface advertises.

    eg: pause_mode = 0x3;

- Default link speed of an interface

    eg: speed = 10000;

- Default supported and advertised modes of an interface.

    eg: supported_modes = 0x1;
        advertised_modes = 0x1;

- Default heartbeat interval (hb_interval) and heartbeat miss count (hb_miss_count) for a PF.
  (Valid only for PF entries)

    eg: hb_interval = 1000;
        hb_miss_count = 20;
