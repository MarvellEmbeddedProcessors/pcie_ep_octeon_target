Marvell SDP Input Rate Limiting
===============================

Host SDP input rate limiting configuration can be done using the following script and cfg file.

target/apps/ratelimit
├── README
├── sdp-iq-rl.cfg
└── sdp-iq-rl.sh

These scripts are to be executed on the Octeon (target) platform.

* sdp-iq-rl.sh
	This script configures the SDP input queue rate limiting at Host side by
	taking the configuration params from the sdp-iq-rl.cfg.
* sdp-iq-rl.cfg
	This cfg file is in CSV format and  contains the rate limiting configuration parameters
	in the following order.
	<VF ID>,<Queue Number>,<Bandwidth in Mbps>
	Example:
		0,0,8000 // This represents to configure Queue number 0 of SDP VF 0 to 8000 Mbps
		0,1,7000 // This represents to configure Queue number 1 of SDP VF 0 to 7000 Mbps
		0,2,6000 // This represents to configure Queue number 2 of SDP VF 0 to 6000 Mbps
		1,0,8000 // This represents to configure Queue number 0 of SDP VF 1 to 8000 Mbps
		1,1,7000 // This represents to configure Queue number 1 of SDP VF 1 to 7000 Mbps
		1,2,6000 // This represents to configure Queue number 2 of SDP VF 1 to 6000 Mbps
		2,0,8000 // This represents to configure Queue number 0 of SDP VF 2 to 8000 Mbps
		2,1,7000 // This represents to configure Queue number 1 of SDP VF 2 to 7000 Mbps
		2,2,6000 // This represents to configure Queue number 2 of SDP VF 2 to 6000 Mbps

* sdp-iq-rl.cfg.run
	The current running rate limiting configuration can be found in this file, only if the
	configuration has been applied  successfully by the script and will be created dynamically
	at the end.

* To disable SDP rate limiting (ie; no rate limiting to be applied), configure bandwidth
  as 0 for the specific VF, Queue pair in sdp-iq-rl.cfg and re-run the sdp-iq-rl.sh script.

How to apply rate limit
-----------------------

Prepare the sdp-iq-rl.cfg file and run the rate limit script as below:

  $cd $APP_DIR/ratelimit
  $sh sdp-iq-rl.sh
